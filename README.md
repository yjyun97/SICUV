Each of the files starting with "fig_" corresponds to a figure in the paper, and the correspondence is shown below. Running each of these files saves the same figure into a folder called "plots" and saves the workspace into a folder called "workspaces" in the working directory. Running fig_penguins.R further saves the results in [Table 1] into a folder called "results".
